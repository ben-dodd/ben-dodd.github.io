          <h2>core personal values</h2>
          <p>
            I value honesty and integrity. I like peace, calm, and order, but
            value those who disrupt and challenge.
          </p>
          <h3>ethics tested</h3>
          <p>
            Going from a humanities degree at Victoria University to a tradie
            job in Sockburn was an ongoing series of ethics tests (&#128517;).
          </p>
          <p>
            One situation that comes to mind in another job involved a task that
            required a simple microscopic test. This test would either give a
            pass or a fail result. The problem was: a fail would result in a bit
            of indirect complaining from management and could create a bit of
            stress. I noticed myself and others feeling pressure to give a pass
            result and counting low rather than sticking to the criteria.
            Although the consequences of analysing a near-pass as a pass result
            were not too serious, this bugged me. I spoke to management about it
            and things were changed to correct the issue.
          </p>
          <h3>culture</h3>
          <p>
            I was brought up in a religious family. This community taught me
            core values, but the rejection of that religion also shapes my
            values. For example, I am more sensitive to people being ostracised
            by a group or expelled from a group, because of my experience with
            and rejection of religious shunning.
          </p>
          <h2>strengths and limitations</h2>
          <h3>learning and career development</h3>
          <p>
            I am good at using initiative to think outside the box and develop
            creative solutions to problems. I have been limited in the past by a
            lack of confidence in my own skills. This has held me back from
            pursuing the career path I wanted and consequently I spent a long
            time just passing time. Since then I have been given the opportunity
            to use my skills in the workplace and this has given me confidence
            in my abilities.
          </p>
          <h3>which strengths help learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I like to test the limits of things while learning and play with the
            capabilities of different tools. I think I have a good attention
            span for exercises that many people find tedious. I like puzzles and
            things. Sorting lists. All that exciting stuff.
          </p>
          <h3>encountering tension in the workplace</h3>
          <p>
            At my workplace, I have tried to make some processes more efficient.
            For example, moving to computer-based solutions rather than using
            paper. This was met with some resistance by people who have always
            used their method. This taught me the importance of explaining why
            you are doing something and respecting peoples’ agency to do things
            their way. In the future I know I need to take a step back and
            question whether changes I am trying to make are in the best
            interests of everyone - or whether I’m just changing something to
            fit with my idea of how it should work.
