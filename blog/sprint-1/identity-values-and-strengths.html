          <h2>core personal values</h2>
          <h3>ethics</h3>
          <p>
            I appreciate honesty and kindness. I get along well with most
            people. I don’t get on well with arrogant or deceitful people, or
            people that use violence to solve problems.
          </p>
          <h3>ethics tested</h3>

          <h3>culture</h3>
          <p>
            I was brought up in a very religious family. This community taught
            me core values, but the rejection of that religion also shapes my
            values. For example, I am more sensitive to people being ostracised
            by a group or expelled from a group, because of my experience with
            and rejection of religious shunning.
          </p>
          <h2>strengths and limitations</h2>
          <h3>learning and career development</h3>
          <p>
            I am good at using initiative to think outside the box and develop
            creative solutions to problems. I have been limited in the past by a
            lack of confidence in my own skills. This has held me back from
            pursuing the career path I wanted and consequently I spent a long
            time just passing time. Since then I have been given the opportunity
            to use my skills in the workplace and this has given me confidence
            in my abilities.
          </p>
          <h3>which strengths help learning?</h3>
          <p>

          <h3>encountering tension in the workplace</h3>
          <p>
            At my workplace, I have tried to make some processes more efficient.
            For example, moving to computer-based solutions rather than using
            paper. This was met with some resistance by people who have always
            used their method. This taught me the importance of explaining why
            you are doing something and respecting peoples’ agency to do things
            their way. In the future I know I need to take a step back and
            question whether changes I am trying to make are in the best
            interests of everyone - or whether I’m just changing something to
            fit with my idea of how it should work.
