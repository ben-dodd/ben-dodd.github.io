          <h2>core personal values</h2>
          <p>
            I appreciate honesty and kindness. I like peace, calm, and order -
            the right plastics in the right bins - but I value people who
            disrupt and test limits.
          </p>
          <h3>ethics tested</h3>
          <p>
            Going from a humanities degree at Victoria University to a tradie
            job in Sockburn was an ongoing series of ethics tests (&#128517;).
          </p>
          <p>
            In seriousness though, sticking to your values against peer pressure
            is hard and can feel futile. Although it can be difficult to change
            the overall culture of a workplace when you're at the bottom, I feel
            like I had some effect (at least on an individual level).
          </p>
          <h3>culture</h3>
          <p>
            I was brought up in a religious family. This community taught me
            core values, but the rejection of that religion also shapes my
            values. For example, I am more sensitive to people being ostracised
            by a group or expelled from a group, because of my experience with
            and rejection of religious shunning.
          </p>
          <h2>strengths and limitations</h2>
          <h3>learning and career development</h3>
          <p>
            I am good at using initiative to think outside the box and develop
            creative solutions to problems. I have been limited in the past by a
            lack of confidence in my own skills. This has held me back from
            pursuing the career path I wanted and consequently I spent a long
            time just passing time. Since then I have been given the opportunity
            to use my skills in the workplace and this has given me confidence
            in my abilities.
          </p>
          <h3>which strengths help learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I like to test the limits of things while learning and play with the
            capabilities of different tools. I think I have a good attention
            span for exercises that many people find tedious. I like puzzles and
            things. Sorting lists. All that exciting stuff.
          </p>
          <h3>encountering tension in the workplace</h3>
          <p>
            At my workplace, I have tried to make some processes more efficient.
            For example, moving to computer-based solutions rather than using
            paper. This was met with some resistance by people who have always
            used their method. This taught me the importance of explaining why
            you are doing something and respecting peoples’ agency to do things
            their way. In the future I know I need to take a step back and
            question whether changes I am trying to make are in the best
            interests of everyone - or whether I’m just changing something to
            fit with my idea of how it should work.
