          <h2>what is emotional intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) refers to a person's ability to
            perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions. Emotional
            intelligence is a very important skill to have and is more important
            than IQ in many respects. Four steps to being emotionally
            intelligent are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Perceiving emotions</li>
            <li>Reasoning with emotions</li>
            <li>Understanding emotions</li>
            <li>Managing emotions</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Five skills that are key to being emotionally intelligent are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-awareness</li>
            <li>Self-regulation</li>
            <li>Social skills</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <li>Motivation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To be emotionally intelligent, one must not only be able to
            understand their own emotions, but should be able to perceive and
            empathise with the emotions of others.
          </p>
          <h2>how is it different to iq?</h2>
          <p>
            IQ is based on the ability of a person to use logic, solve problems,
            and grasp complex ideas. Emotional intelligence, on the other hand,
            is the ability to recognise emotion in yourself and others and to
            act on that awareness.
          </p>
          <h2>why is it important?</h2>
          <p>
            Components of emotional intelligence are key to being successful in
            your work. At higher levels, it becomes more and more important as
            your responsibility over others and the need to work with many other
            workers increases.
