          <h2>javascript and its relationship to html and css?</h2>
          <p>
            If you've spent much time on the Internet, you've probably seen the
            words <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>JavaScript</em>. What
            exactly do these words mean?
          </p>

          <p>
            All three are languages used to make websites (don't call HTML and
            CSS programming languages or some people get mad).
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It was invented as a
            publishing language for the web. Basically, HTML is used to lay out
            the bones of the website.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The headings</li>
            <li>The paragraphs</li>
            <li>The links</li>
            <li>The images</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This language is used to
            define a style for a website. In the old days, you could do a lot of
            styling without CSS. For example the HTML &lt;font&gt; tag could set
            attributes like colour, font, and size. However, this and other
            style-oriented features were removed with HTML5 which came out in
            2008. Now, the only way to really style your HTML is with CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML and CSS alone can be used to make simple sites like a small
            blog or business website. So where does Javascript come in?
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a powerful <i>programming</i> language that can bring
            to life an otherwise static website. It is essential if you want a
            website to be interactive and dynamic. JavaScript can change a
            website based on input from the user or data from another source.
            The uses of JavaScript are pretty much endless. 98% of websites
            today use JavaScript for their browser-end functionality.
          </p>
          <h2>control flow and loops</h2>
          <p>
            Computer programming is all about giving instructions to the
            computer. The <em>control flow</em> refers to the order that the
            computer does these instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can think of the control flow in terms of simple tasks we do
            every day. The example below shows a (very simplified) long-term
            task that could be explained with control flow and loops.
          </p>
          <pre>
age = 0                         The child is born
name = "Toby"                   The child is named Toby
toiletTrained = false           The child is not toilet trained
                                (by default)

while not toiletTrained         This line tells the computer to
do every hour {                 do the following code every hour
                                until the child is toilet
                                trained  

    check nappies               The nappies are checked
    if nappies are dirty        If the nappies are dirty, do the
                                following steps
      remove dirty nappy
      clean baby
      put clean nappy on
      discard dirty nappy
      wash hands
    otherwise
      set toiletTrained to true Otherwise, the baby is now
                                toilet-trained!
                                This breaks out of the
                                loop
continue loop
say "{name} is toilet trained!" The parents are now out of the
                                toilet-trianing loop and
                                celebrate with a shout.
                      </pre
          >
          <p>
            The order that you put instructions in can be a cause of errors in
            code. For example, what would happen with the last line of the code
            above if we hadn't set that name to Toby at the start?
          </p>
          <h2>the dom</h2>
          <p>
            The <em>DOM</em> is short for the Document Object Model. This is the
            hierarchical representation of a web page. You can think of the DOM
            like a tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            The earth is like the <code>window</code> element, upon which is
            planted the <code>document</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DOM organises all elements on the page into a hierarchical
            structure so they can be accessed and manipulated. If the DOM was a
            tree, we might want to select all <b>apples</b> or change the colour
            of the <b>blossoms</b> to purple. Or we might want to chop off a
            whole branch and everything connected to it.
          </p>
          <img src="../../images/tree.jpeg" class="blog-image" />
          <p>
            In a similar way, we can select all elements of a similar type (like
            all paragraphs) or select elements by their id or class. Once
            selected, we can change the style of the elements, remove them, or
            add new elements to them.
          </p>
          <h2>arrays vs objects</h2>
          <p>
            Arrays and objects are two data structures you can use in
            JavaScript. Both have advantages and disadvantages. It may not
            always be obvious which one is the best to use for a particular
            scenario.
          </p>
          <h3>Arrays</h3>
          <p>
            Arrays are basically just lists of things. This could be a list of
            strings (text) or numbers, or it could be an array of arrays or an
            array of objects. Arrays have a number of built-in functions in
            JavaScript that can be very powerful for easily manipulating sets of
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays store data in an ordered list. Each entry in the list can be
            selected by using its index (where it is in the list). The first
            index in an array is always 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lets say we have an array of names called
            <code>firstNames</code> that looks like this:
          </p>
          <code>["Jeff","Mike","Brian"]</code>
          <p>With the indices showing it looks like this.</p>
          <code>[0: "Jeff", 1: "Mike", 2: "Brian"]</code>
          <p>
            To access the third name in the list, we would do:
            <code>firstNames[2]</code>. We use "2" instead of "3" to get the
            third name, because the indices start at 0.
          </p>
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#instance_methods"
            >Check out the Instance Methods for arrays at MDN.</a
          >
          <h3>Objects</h3>
          <p>
            Objects are data structures that store data in sets of key/value
            pairs. The object might be a customer at a supermarket that you want
            to store and track. It might look like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
  const customer = {
    name: "Greta",
    age: 47,
    favouriteItems: ["apples", "bananas", "cheese", "muesli bars"]
  }
            </pre
          >
          <p>
            Note how objects use curly braces {} and arrays use square brackets
            []. This is an important distinction.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access a value in an object, we use the "key" of that value. So
            to access the name of the customer we go
            <code>customer.name</code> or to access the age we would use
            <code>customer.age</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice the favouriteItems value is an array. To access the second
            item in that list we would need to use a mix of object and array
            accessors. This would look like
            <code>customer.favouriteItems[1]</code>.
          </p>
          <h2>functions (and why they are helpful)</h2>
          <p>
            Functions are like little sets of instructions. They need to be
            given a name, and they can also take parameters. Functions are
            defined with the <code>function</code> keyword. Usually functions
            will return a value using the <code>return</code> keyword. However,
            this is not always the case. For example you might have a function
            that just does an action like pops up an alert to the user. An
            example of a simple function that adds two numbers is below.
          </p>
          <pre>
    function myAddingFunction(varA, varB) {
      return varA + varB
    }
          </pre>
          <p>
            On its own, this function will not do anything. To use the function
            we need to <em>call</em> it. This could be done like so.
          </p>
          <code>let myAddedNumbers = myAddingFunction(5, 10)</code>
          <p>
            This bit of code has made a variable <code>myAddedNumbers</code> and
            assigned to it the return value of
            <code>myAddingFunction(5, 10)</code>. The value of
            <code>myAddedNumbers</code> will be 15.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value of functions may not seem that obvious when you are only
            doing simple arithmetic, but it soon becomes apparent once your
            project grows.
          </p>
          <p>An important principle in software development is DRY.</p>
          <p><b>DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF</b></p>
          <p>
            If we have code that repeats itself, any modification of a task
            requires it to be modified everywhere it occurs in the code. By
            writing functions, we can change the task in one place and this will
            be changed everywhere we use that function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using functions also makes code easier to read for anyone that has
            to go through it after us (including our future selves).
          </p>
