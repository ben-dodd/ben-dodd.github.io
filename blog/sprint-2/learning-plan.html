          <h2>goals and strengths</h2>
          <h3>long-term goal and career pathway</h3>
          <p>
            In many ways I would like to continue as I have been to this point
            (but with more success): finding projects I like and bringing my
            skills together to complete them. I would like to do more
            inventor-type projects involving Raspberry Pis and electronics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Career-wise, I would love to work for a web or mobile app company. I
            know how much poorly-made apps can ruin your day, especially if you
            are made to use them for work. I think I have something special to
            offer - a unique set of skills. I would like to try both UX design
            and front-end developing.
          </p>
          <h3>strengths and limitations in learning</h3>
          <p>
            I like to test the limits of things while learning and play with the
            capabilities of different tools. I think I have a good attention
            span for exercises that many people find tedious. I like puzzles and
            things. Sorting lists. All that exciting stuff.
          </p>

          <h3>core skills i would like to develop at eda</h3>
          <p>
            I feel like I am pretty good at working in a team and getting along
            with others - but this could definitely be improved. I would like to
            become better at explaining my ideas and getting other people
            involved in making them happen.
          </p>
          <h2>commitment to the programme</h2>

          <h3>
            how will i manage myself to work productively and safely with other
            learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
          </h3>
          <p>
            Communication is key. I will make the effort to check in with others
            about where I'm at and offer help where I can. If I'm struggling,
            I'll make sure to contact the facilitators and ask for help.
          </p>
          <h3>
            what will i do when things are building up and starting to get to me
          </h3>
          <p>
            As above, I will communicate if I'm feeling overwhelmed. I
            understand that there is help I can access and will keep check of my
            mental health so I can manage the course along with other life
            commitments.
          </p>
          <h3>how and where i will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>
            I will seek help from facilitators, and other students, when I need
            it. I will also need to explain to family and friends if I need help
            or if I need them to help me out with other commitments.
          </p>

          <h3>what do i expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            I expect to have a reciprocal relationship of respect with the
            facilitation team. I know they'll treat my questions and concerns
            seriously, so I'm feeling confident I'll be able to get what I want
            out of this course.
          </p>

          <h3>scheduling information</h3>
          <p>
            I am working during foundations but have arranged with my work to
            prioritise the programme during bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            My only time commitments during the bootcamp are school pickups and
            dropoffs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wednesday 2:50-3:15pm</li>
            <li>Thursday 8:30-8:40am</li>
            <li>Friday 8:30-8:40am and 2:50-3:15pm</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>bootcamp learning plan</h2>
          <h3>long term goal and career pathway</h3>
          <p>
            My goal is to initially get a job as a Junior Developer to learn how
            to code in a professional environment. If I enjoy it, I'd like to
            stick at it and advance my career. If it's not for me as a career,
            I'd like to continue coding personal projects.
          </p>
          <h3>how do i hope to use the skills i will learn?</h3>
          <p>
            I would like to make work in an artistic sphere. I'm also interested
            in making apps for large projects. I would like to have a go at
            doing things like survey apps. I think those are a real challenge to
            make user friendly and efficient. I've tried making them before but
            would like to have another go after learning skills at Bootcamp.
            Improving these kinds of apps that people have to use for work can
            make a big difference to workplace enjoyment - I feel I can make a
            difference there.
          </p>
          <h3>strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>
            My strengths are that I have experience in JS so that gives me an
            advantage - particularly during the early part of the course. I feel
            like I'm a quick learner too. My limitations will be due to time and
            other commitments. I'll need to keep an eye on my tiredness and
            stress levels to make sure I'm not stretching myself too far.
          </p>
          <h3>reevaluation of strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>
            I think my idea of my strengths and limitations has changed somewhat
            after experiencing the Foundations course.
          </p>
          <h3>biggest non-technical challenge</h3>
          <p>
            My biggest non-technical challenge will be waking up for the morning
            check-ins. I struggle with getting up so this is going to be a bit
            of a shock.
          </p>
          <h3>what human skills do i want to develop</h3>
          <p>
            I really want to develop communicating ideas to people. Technical
            ideas are difficult to explain but I believe it's very important to
            have that skill.
          </p>
          <h3>what are some areas for development i would like to work on</h3>
          <p>
            As above, I would like to develop communication skills mainly.
            During the Bootcamp, I would like to take the opportunity of working
            from home to improve my exercise regime.
          </p>
          <h3>what are my expectations from the bootcamp team</h3>
          <p>
            My expectations are as they were for Foundations. I'd like to be
            able to go through any problems that are not directly related to the
            coursework, but I understand if this is not feasible with the
            timeframes.
          </p>
          <h3>what are my expectations of myself during bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            I expect to be able to complete the coursework without getting too
            stressed or swamped. If I manage my time correctly I am confident I
            can do it.
          </p>
          <h3>where will i seek help?</h3>
          <p>
            I'll seek help from the course facilitators as well as my support
            network.
          </p>
          <h3>my commitment to the workload</h3>
          <p>
            I'm committing to spending 60 hours per week on coursework over the
            9-week bootcamp. I will get involved in group activities and
            participate as much as I can. I will offer support to others when
            they need it but will endeavour to do this in such a way that there
            learning path isn't compromised.
