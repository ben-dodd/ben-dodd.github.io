          <h2>goals and strengths</h2>
          <h3>long-term goal and career pathway</h3>
          <p>
            In many ways I would like to continue as I have been to this point
            (but with more success): finding projects I like and bringing my
            skills together to complete them. I would like to do more
            inventor-type projects involving Raspberry Pis and electronics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Career-wise, I would love to work for a web or mobile app company. I
            know how much poorly-made apps can ruin your day, especially if you
            are made to use them for work. I think I have something special to
            offer - a unique set of skills. I would like to try both UX design
            and front-end developing.
          </p>
          <h3>strengths and limitations in learning</h3>
          <p>
            I like to test the limits of things while learning and play with the
            capabilities of different tools. I think I have a good attention
            span for exercises that many people find tedious. I like puzzles and
            things. Sorting lists. All that exciting stuff.
          </p>

          <h3>core skills i would like to develop at eda</h3>
          <p>
            I feel like I am pretty good at working in a team and getting along
            with others - but this could definitely be improved. I would like to
            become better at explaining my ideas and getting other people
            involved in making them happen.
          </p>
          <h2>commitment to the programme</h2>

          <h3>
            how will i manage myself to work productively and safely with other
            learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
          </h3>
          <p>
            Communication is key. I will make the effort to check in with others
            about where I'm at and offer help where I can. If I'm struggling,
            I'll make sure to contact the facilitators and ask for help.
          </p>
          <h3>
            what will i do when things are building up and starting to get to me
          </h3>
          <p>
            As above, I will communicate if I'm feeling overwhelmed. I
            understand that there is help I can access and will keep check of my
            mental health so I can manage the course along with other life
            commitments.
          </p>
          <h3>how and where i will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>
            I will seek help from facilitators, and other students, when I need
            it. I will also need to explain to family and friends if I need help
            or if I need them to help me out with other commitments.
          </p>

          <h3>what do i expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            I expect to have a reciprocal relationship of respect with the
            facilitation team. I know they'll treat my questions and concerns
            seriously, so I'm feeling confident I'll be able to get what I want
            out of this course.
          </p>

          <h3>scheduling information</h3>
          <p>
            I am working during foundations but have arranged with my work to
            prioritise the programme during bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            My only time commitments during the bootcamp are school pickups and
            dropoffs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wednesday 2:50-3:15pm</li>
            <li>Thursday 8:30-8:40am</li>
            <li>Friday 8:30-8:40am and 2:50-3:15pm</li>
          </ul>
