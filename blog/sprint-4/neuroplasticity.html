          <h2>neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form and reorganise
            synaptic connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            In earlier times, researchers believed that the creation of new
            neurons stopped shortly after birth. These days, we know that the
            brain has the ability to reorganise pathways, create new
            connections, and even create new neurons.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to improve our neuroplasticity is by enriching our
            environment. We can do this by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Learning new things, like a new language or musical instrument
            </li>
            <li>Travelling and exploring</li>
            <li>Creating art and other creative pursuits</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Besides this, it is important to take care of ourselves with lots of
            rest and maintaining healthy habits.
          </p>

            Simply understanding that our brains have this ability, can have
            improvements on our learning. Understanding that intelligence can be
            developed will give us a <em>growth mindset</em>. What is a growth
            mindset?
          </p>
          <h2>growth mindset</h2>
          <p>
            The Growth Mindset refers to the way of thinking that understands
            that intelligence can be developed. The alternative to this is the
            Fixed Mindset.
          </p>
          <table width="100%">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Growth Mindset</th>
                <th>Fixed Mindset</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Intelligence can be developed</td>
                <td>Intelligence is static</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Embrace challenges</td>
                <td>Avoid challenges</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Persist through obstacles</td>
                <td>Give up easily</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>See effort positively</td>
                <td>See effort negatively</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Learn from criticism</td>
                <td>Ignore negative feedback</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Find inspiration through others' success</td>
                <td>Feel threatened by others' success</td>
              </tr>

            Having a Growth Mindset will allow you to continue improving and
            learning throughout your adult life. It should be noted that you may
            have a Growth Mindset in one aspect of your life but not in others.
            For example, you may have a Growth Mindset in your career and always
            take on new challenges. But at the same time, you could have a Fixed
            Mindset with your health, thinking that you will never be fit enough
            to bike to work or go for regular runs.
          </p>
          <h2>how i'm going to use the growth mindset</h2>
          <p>
            The idea that you can have both a Growth and Fixed Mindset really
            resonated with me. My goal for learning is to develop a Growth
            Mindset with regard to health and exercise. This will, in turn,
            improve my neuroplasticity and hopefully create a wonderful feedback
            loop.
