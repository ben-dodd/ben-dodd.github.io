          <h2>three things i have learnt about myself and my ego</h2>
          <p>
            <ol><li>I've realised there are areas in my life where I exhibit a fixed mindset. There are fewer of them than there used to be, but they are still there. Particularly when it comes to health.</li>
              <li>I've learnt that I still find it difficult to talk about myself when I'm out of my comfort zone.</li>
              <li>I've learnt the importance of developing emotional intelligence for improving your positive mental attitude.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h2>what are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          <p>These values are part of emotional intelligence. Being emotionally intelligence will allow you to tackle complex problems where things are ambiguous, changing, uncertain, and complex. Having these qualities will help you to work with others and are especially useful if you have managerial positions.</p>
          <h2>what has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          <p>I'm surprised how much I got out of this part of the course. I think it has had a noticeable effect on my attitude and general outlook.</p>
          <h2>what were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>The most difficult aspect of core learning was reflecting on and answering the questions honestly. There is not only the work of exploring these challenging topics, but it is also difficult being able to explain it in a way that doesn't misrepresent you or confuse your readers.</p>
          <h2>why do eda spend so much time focusing on core learning?</h2>
          <p>The tech industry isn't just about writing code. To work with others, and to communicate with clients, personal skills are very important. Teamwork is an important part of the tech industry.</p>
          <h2>does the time you spent studying core feel like a waste of time?</h2>
          <p>No. As above, I feel like I got a lot out of these few weeks. I understand the reasoning for doing the core work so it doesn't feel like a waste of time. These skills are harder to teach than the tech part of the course so I appreciate the effort.</p>
